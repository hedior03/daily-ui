Today's session is all about the pull and the floor — a deadlift-centred back day built to push past that 140 kg PR while layering in quality volume for the lats, hamstrings, biceps, and rear delts.

    Keep these movements slow and deliberate. Focus on feeling the hamstring load in the RDL and opening up the hips — don't rush into working sets cold.

  <ExerciseCard
    name="Conventional Deadlift — Ramp Sets"
    sets={3}
    reps="3"
    rest="2 min"
    rpe={6}
  />

  <FormCue label="Ramp Set Strategy">
    Build in 3 ramp sets to your top working set: ~60%, ~75%, ~87% of your target. These are not junk — treat each rep with full focus and the same setup routine every time.
  </FormCue>

  <ExerciseCard
    name="Conventional Deadlift — Top Set"
    sets={1}
    reps="3"
    rest="3 min"
    rpe={8.5}
  />

  <FormCue label="PR Approach">
    Current PR is 140 kg. Aim for a strong, confident 3-rep top set at ~130–135 kg today — building the base for a PR attempt in the coming weeks. Brace hard, drive the floor away, lock out with glutes not hyperextension.
  </FormCue>

  <ExerciseCard
    name="Conventional Deadlift — Back-Off Sets"
    sets={3}
    reps="4"
    rest="2 min 30s"
    rpe={7}
  />

  <FormCue label="Bar Path">
    Keep the bar dragging your shins the entire way up. Any forward drift will bleed tension from the posterior chain and increase injury risk. Wear your socks if needed.
  </FormCue>

  <FormCue label="RDL Depth Cue">
    Hinge until you feel a deep stretch in the hamstrings — typically bar passes the knee by ~10 cm. Don't chase floor depth at the cost of a rounded lower back. Control the descent for 2–3 seconds.

    Drive the elbow straight back and squeeze the mid-trap at the top for a full second. Avoid shrugging — depress the shoulder blades before you initiate each pull.

    Set the cable at head height. Pull to your ears — not your chin — with elbows flaring high. This protects the shoulder joint and properly targets the posterior cuff and rear delt.

**Session Notes:** With the Wednesday pull session earlier this week, keep today's top-set RPE honest — an RPE 8.5 that feels like RPE 9 is a sign to cap the weight and bank the quality. Recovery across the week matters more than any single Saturday number. Stay patient, stay consistent.
