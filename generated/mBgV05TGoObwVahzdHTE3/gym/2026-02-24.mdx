Tuesday is a **scheduled rest day** on your Push/Pull/Legs split. No lifting today — use this time to recover, stay mobile, and set yourself up for a strong Wednesday Pull session.

<MuscleGroups groups={["Full Body", "Mobility", "Flexibility", "Recovery"]} />

<FormCue label="Why Rest Days Matter">
  Muscle growth happens during recovery, not during the session itself. Skipping rest days accumulates fatigue that blunts strength and hypertrophy gains over time. Protect your Wednesday Pull and Saturday Deadlift sessions by recovering fully today.

    Keep this slow and deliberate — this is not a warm-up, it's active recovery. Breathe into tight areas and don't rush through reps.

## Tomorrow: Wednesday Pull

Wednesday brings your **Pull session** — back, biceps, and rear delts. Make sure you're well hydrated and have eaten adequately today to fuel tomorrow's training.

| Priority | Focus |
|---|---|
| Primary compound | Barbell or Cable Row |
| Vertical pull | Weighted Pull-Ups or Lat Pulldown |
| Rear delt work | Face Pulls, Reverse Flyes |
| Bicep isolation | Curls — hammer + supinated |

> **Sleep target:** Aim for 7–9 hours tonight. Sleep is the highest-leverage recovery tool available.
