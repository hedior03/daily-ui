<WorkoutSection title="Primary Lift — Barbell Bench Press">

<FormCue label="Setup & Technique">
  Retract and depress your scapulae before unracking. Keep a slight arch in your lower back, feet flat on the floor. Bar path should travel in a slight diagonal — touch the lower chest, press back toward the rack. Control the descent for 2 seconds.
</FormCue>

  rpe={8}
  rest="2 min"

<FormCue label="Incline Angle">
  Set the bench to 30–45°. Keep elbows at roughly 60–70° from your torso — avoid flaring them out wide to protect the shoulder joint.

<ExerciseCard
  name="Seated Dumbbell Overhead Press"
  sets={3}
  reps="8–10"
  rpe={8}
  rest="2 min"
/>

<FormCue label="Overhead Press Tip">
  Press in a slight forward arc rather than straight up — this is more natural for shoulder mechanics. Avoid letting the lower back hyperextend; brace your core throughout.
</FormCue>

  sets={4}
