Friday Legs. This session prioritises quad development and glute drive through compound squatting, supported by hamstring isolation and calf work to round out the lower body. Keep intensity high on the main lifts and treat the accessories with intention — they build the base your deadlift day relies on.

<WorkoutSection title="Main Lifts — Squat Focus">

  <FormCue label="Squat Setup">
    Bar should sit mid-trap (high bar) or across the rear delts (low bar). Brace your core hard before unracking — big breath in, 360° of pressure. Drive knees out in line with toes throughout the descent.
  </FormCue>

  <ExerciseCard
    name="Back Squat"
    sets={4}
    reps="5–6"
    rest="3 min"
    rpe={8}
    id="back-squat"
  />

  <FormCue label="Depth & Bracing">
    Aim for at least parallel — hip crease below the knee. If depth is inconsistent, drop the weight and rebuild. A beltless set at moderate load occasionally is a great bracing check.
  </FormCue>

  <ExerciseCard
    name="Romanian Deadlift (RDL)"
    sets={3}
    reps="8–10"
    rest="2 min"
    rpe={7}
    id="rdl"
  />

  <FormCue label="RDL Hinge Pattern">
    Push the hips back, not down. Maintain a neutral spine and keep the bar close to your legs throughout. You should feel a deep hamstring stretch at the bottom — stop before rounding the lower back.
  </FormCue>

  <FormCue label="Leg Extension Safety">
    Use a controlled tempo — 2 seconds up, 2 seconds down. Avoid locking out aggressively at the top to protect the knee joint under load.

  <FormCue label="Hip Thrust Glute Activation">
    At the top of the movement, squeeze the glutes hard and hold for a full second. Avoid hyperextending the lower back — ribs should stay down, pelvis should posteriorly tilt at lockout.

  <FormCue label="Full Range on Calves">
    Get a full stretch at the bottom — heel below the platform — and a full contraction at the top. Half-reps are the most common mistake here. Slow the eccentric down to 3 seconds.
