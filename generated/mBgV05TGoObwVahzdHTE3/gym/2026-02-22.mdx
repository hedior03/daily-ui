Sunday is a scheduled **rest day** — no heavy lifting today. Use this session for active recovery: keep the blood moving, address any tight spots from the week, and set yourself up for a strong Monday Push session.

<WorkoutSection title="Foam Rolling & Soft Tissue">

<FormCue label="Pressure & Pace">
  Move slowly — 1–2 inches per second. Pause for 3–5 seconds on any tender spots rather than rolling quickly over them. Breathe through the discomfort.

<WorkoutSection title="Deadlift Primer — Hinge Pattern Reinforcement">

Use this as low-load motor pattern work to keep your hip hinge sharp ahead of **Saturday's deadlift focus day**. Empty bar or light KB only — this is NOT training, it's movement practice.

<FormCue label="Deadlift Cue Review">
  Focus on the three cues: **push the floor away** off the ground, **squeeze the armpits toward your hips** to lock the lats, and **drive the hips through** at lockout. Ingrain these before Saturday's heavy session.
</FormCue>

> **Tomorrow is Monday — Push Day.** Make sure you're well hydrated and have eaten enough carbohydrates today to fuel chest, triceps, and delt work. Target 7–9 hours of sleep tonight.
