Wednesday's Pull session targets the full back, biceps, and rear delts — building the thickness and width that support your deadlift and overall physique balance. Keep every rep controlled and feel the target muscle working.

  <ExerciseCard

    reps="20"

    rest="45s"

  <FormCue label="Shoulder prep">
    During band pull-aparts, keep a slight bend in your elbows and squeeze your rear delts at the end range — this primes the rotator cuff and sets you up for safe pulling patterns.

    sets={4}
    reps="6–8"
    rest="2 min"
    rpe={8}
    id="barbell-bent-over-row"
  />

  <FormCue label="Barbell Row technique">
    Hinge to roughly 45°, brace your core hard, and drive your elbows behind your torso — not out to the sides. Lower the bar under control for a 2-second eccentric to maximise lat engagement.
  </FormCue>

  <ExerciseCard
    name="Weighted Pull-Up"

    id="weighted-pull-up"
  />

  <FormCue label="Pull-Up cue">
    Initiate the pull by depressing your scapulae before you bend your elbows. Think "elbows to hips" rather than "chin over bar" to keep the lats as the prime mover.

  <FormCue label="Straight-Arm Pulldown">
    Keep your arms almost fully extended throughout — this is a lat isolation move, not a row. Hinge slightly at the hips and arc the cable attachment down to your thighs, squeezing hard at the bottom.

    id="face-pull"
  />

  <FormCue label="Face Pull form">
    Pull toward your forehead — not your chin — with your elbows flared high. Pause and externally rotate at the end position for a full rear delt and rotator cuff contraction. This also counteracts anterior shoulder stress from Push days.

  <FormCue label="Incline Curl advantage">
    The inclined angle puts the long head of the bicep in a stretched position at the bottom — maximise this by letting your arms hang fully before each rep and curling slowly through the full range.
