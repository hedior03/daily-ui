Thursday is a scheduled **rest day** in your Push/Pull/Legs split. Use today to support recovery ahead of tomorrow's Leg Day — a short active recovery session will keep you mobile and primed without adding fatigue.

<MuscleGroups groups={["Full Body", "Hip Flexors", "Thoracic Spine", "Hamstrings", "Calves"]} />

<FormCue label="Why Active Recovery?">
  Light movement and stretching on rest days increases blood flow to muscle tissue, reduces DOMS, and improves range of motion — all of which directly support your deadlift progress and leg day performance tomorrow.

    Keep this genuinely easy — you should be able to hold a full conversation. The goal is circulation, not conditioning.

  <FormCue label="Hip Mobility & Your Deadlift">
    Tight hip flexors and limited hip internal rotation are two of the most common limiters on deadlift depth and bar path. Consistent 90/90 work directly targets both — prioritise this on every rest day.

  <FormCue label="Thoracic Extension">
    When foam rolling the thoracic spine, pause at tight spots and breathe out fully — don't just roll back and forth quickly. 3–4 deep exhales per stuck segment makes a significant difference.
  </FormCue>

  <FormCue label="Ankle Mobility for Squats & Deadlifts">
    Restricted ankle dorsiflexion forces your heels to rise in a squat and shifts loading unevenly in Romanian deadlifts. This is a small investment that pays off directly in leg day performance tomorrow.

## Rest Day Checklist

Use this as a quick reference for the non-training factors that support your **140kg deadlift goal** and overall muscle-building progress:

| Factor | Target |
|---|---|
| **Sleep** | 7–9 hours tonight |
| **Protein** | Hit your daily target (body-weight × ~1.8–2.2 g/kg) |
| **Hydration** | 2.5–3.5 L water |
| **Stress** | Keep cortisol low — rest days matter mentally too |
| **Tomorrow** | Leg Day — Quads, Hamstrings, Glutes, Calves |
